    <h2>Goddess of Love, Beauty, Prosperity, Fertility, and Victory</h2>
    
        <h3>
            -- In Greek mythology, after Cronus overthrew his father Uranus, she cast his father's severed genitals into the sea, 
            creating foam from which Aphrodite, was born. 
            Known as Venus in Roman mythology, she emerged fully formed from the sea, 
            symbolizing beauty and grace.<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Venus-goddess"> Learn More! </a>
        </h3>
     
        <p>
            Venus is the Roman goddess of love, beauty, prosperity, fertility, and victory. 
            She was so important to Romans that they claimed her as their ancestress. According to mythology, 
            her son Aeneas fled from Troy to Italy. He became the ancestor of Remus and Romulus, who founded Rome. So, in a way, 
            it’s accurate to say that Venus was the mother of Rome. However, Venus had strong ties to Greek mythology, too. 
            The Romans thought she was the same goddess as Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. 
            They adopted many of Aphrodite’s symbols, such as roses and myrtle, to represent Venus.
